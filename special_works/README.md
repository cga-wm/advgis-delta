# Special Works Projects
This folder contains the specials works projects you are expected to solve together.
Each special works project has its own folder with a README that includes links to an introduction video, GitHub discussion and a shared Google doc.

* The discussion board provides a time-stamped chronology of questions and answers.
* Use the Google doc for real-time collaboration, as you can simultaneously edit, reorganize, comment, and share ideas.

You have to present two solutions: one project of your choice and one project chosen by your instructor; however, you don't know which project your instructor will ask you to solve!
At some point in the semester, each group (undergraduates, certificate students, and instructor) will choose a project they don't want considered for the final evaluation.

The project of your choice may be solved in one of two ways:

1. Written submission
    
    A detailed decription of your methods beginning with an empty project (for those who chose the analysis focus) or empty notebook (for those who chose the programming focus).
    You may use any additional tools or references to help you answer the problem; however, they must be included in your solution methods using a step-by-step explanation.
    You may include screenshots, figures, images, tables, or other graphics/media.
    This method is valid only for "Basic Level" submissions.
2. Video submission

    A reproducible depiction of your methods beginning with an empty project (for those who chose the analysis focu) or an empty notebook (for those who chose the programming focus).
    You may use any additional tools or references to help you answer the problem; however, they must be included and explained in your video.
    This method is valid for basic to advanced submissions.
    The time limit of video submissions is based on your responses to the discussion question.

Each project has tiered levels for completion.
Consider the "Basic Level" for "Fully Meets Expectations" and the "Intermediate Level" for "Exceeds Expectations" (GIS 420 students) or "Advanced Level" for "Exceeds Expectations" (GIS 520 students).
